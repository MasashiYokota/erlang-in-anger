Maintaining and debugging software never ends. New bugs and confusing behaviours will keep popping up around the place all the time. There would probably be enough stuff out there to fill out dozens of manuals like this one, even when dealing with the cleanest of all systems. 

I hope that after reading this text, the next time stuff goes bad, it won't go \emph{too} bad. Still, there are probably going to be plenty of opportunities to debug production systems. Even the most solid bridges need to be repainted all the time in order avoid corrosion to the point of their collapse.

Best of luck to you.
